# Brian Tiedt - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I applied to Turing because I want a better quaity of life for me and my kids. I really wanted to learn how 
to work in javascript, and have a better understanding of how code is structured and how it operates.

## A: End of Module Assessment

(Indicate whether you passed or failed the end of module assessment)

## B: Individual Work & Projects

I realy enjoy seeing how things relate to each other and being able to create something new that did not exist before. The projects were increasing with difficulty. I really enjoyed being able to build upon the experience we gainned in class.

#### Static Comp Challenge 1

* [GitHub URL] (https://github.com/bmtiedt/bt-comp-challenge-1)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-1.html)

Static Comp Challenge 1 -  I really enjoyed learning CSS flexbox and grid and how 
shifting grid and flex properties can make responsive design much easier. FlexBoxFroggy and CssGridGarden are great tools and a fun way to get familiar with those plans.

#### Static Comp Challenge 2

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bmtiedt/bt-comp-challenge-2.0)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/m1-static-comp-2.html)

This comp challenge is my favorite. Taking the advice of my instructors, in that this is a tool to attain a job; I chose a subject that I have conection to, which made the project much eaiser to focus on details.

#### Number Guesser

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bmtiedt/bt-number-guesser1.2)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/number-guesser.html)

Number Guesser is the first project that starts off Javascript.There are a number of hurdles to cross, being the first Js project; preventDefault, toggleButton, clearInput.......these items become staples that are used very frequently.

### Projects

Paring projects are a great way for both people to not only learn about coding but is a great way to learn how to interact with various personalities.  

#### Linked List

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bmtiedt/bt-ct-linked-listx)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/linked-list.html)

Linked List is a web application that a user can access to compile a list of web bookmarks for later viewing. 
This project introduced the concepts of `this`, dynamically generated page content, and event bubbling and 
delegation. I really enjoyed this project; working with David was definitely a highlight. He really helped me get a
 jumpstart on understanding jQuery.

#### IdeaBox

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/bmtiedt/bt-jh-ideabox)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html)

IdeaBox is a web application that a user can access to compile a list of their greatest ideas. AND! It 
persists on page load. This project introduced the concepts of local storage, JSON, and array prototype 
methods. I liked that this project  was truly functional, in the sense that I could host this code somewhere 
and someone could presumably use this application.

#### 2DoBox - Pivot

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/front-end-submissions-public/blob/master/1804/mod-1/to-do-box/michael-brian.md)
* [Original Assignment](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/2DoBox-Pivot-Mod1.html)

For me, 2DoBox was less about the project itself than it was about learning how to approach someone else' 
codebase. I think my initial response would have been to burn it all down. I feel like this project gave me some insight into what it will be like to work on code that I didn't write, and why developer empathy is so important.

### Gear Up

This mod we began to cultivate the soft skills that will eventually help us in our development careers. While I sometimes
went to these sessions begrudgingly, I can definitely see their value and how they will help us in our professional lives.

#### Week 1: Mental Health 101

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week1_mental_health_101.md)

We began our gear ups at Turing by discussing mental health. I think that this gear up helped me remember the unproductive things I do to help me manage my stress. The reality is that Turing is really intense, so I think it was really valuable to reflect on all of the different ways to approach
 and manage stress under a heavy workload. 

#### Week 2: Working Styles

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/m1_citizenship/session_3_intro_extro_ambivert_styles.markdown)

During this session, we discussed the multitude of different working styles that people have. We lined 
ourselves up on a spectrum from extroversion to introversion. Having a baseline understanding of where
people are coming from helps me understand what I need to do to give my peers the best possible chance
of being successful and making a contribution to my cohort myself. I can use my strength of initiator to 
activate others and leverage their abilities. 

#### Week 3: Code Debugging The Gender Gap

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/Mod1_Week3_Code_debugging_compact_version.md)

Representation and equality are values that I hold really strongly. I really appreciate that Turing is so 
focused on creating an inclusive and representative space. I think that the clips of the documentary 
that we watched really helped me understand the pitfalls of the development community and how much more 
work needs to be done for the technology sector to truly represent the people that are using their products. 

#### Week 4: Winning through failing, Mod 4 facilitated

I really enjoyed watching the mod 4 students lead their own gear ups. This was a great insight to how we should take our failures as progress and not as a loss.

## E: Community Participation

### Playing a Part

I really enjoyed being able to help with my fellow humans with whatever obsticles come there way. If I was not able to help them directly, I was able to point them in the right direction.
